# 📊 MAS-I: Modern Actuarial Statistics I

## Overview

This is Sam's personal study repository containing comprehensive study notes and R code for the **Modern Actuarial Statistics I (MAS-I) exam**. While I took a career break, I have continued dedicating time to studying for this challenging actuarial examination.

## 🎯 About This Project

This repository serves as a learning resource for actuarial science students studying for the MAS-I exam. It contains detailed notes, R code examples, and datasets used in practice problems and analysis.
